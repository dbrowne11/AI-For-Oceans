A majority of our work was within our frontend UI.  Two major components existed in our process to test and accept work in the frontend.  
For functionality tests, we manually interacted with each component on our website.
Additionally, we would continually update our client on our process and seek their input regarding design choices

Daniel Testing:
  For each information page (people, voices, and mission), there are no interactive components within the page so testing consisted of ensuring that each page was accessible, 
    and ensuring that all information was correctly displayed on the page (which was done visually)
    
Veshant Testing:
  For the datasets page, tested that each all datasets in the database were displayed with the correct information.
    The download and view source buttons directed to the correct pages.
    The dataset search bar lists out the available datasets.  However the search is not functional.
  For the individual dataset pages, tested that the url brought to the correct dataset page.
    The download and view source buttons directed to the correct pages.
